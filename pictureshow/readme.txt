PictureShow 1.01

VERSION 1.01
- Uses new FreeImage library


Right-click for the main menu.


This is a simple program I wrote so my friend and I could browse anime easily.
Paint Shop Pro's browser only goes so far.  ^_^  All you have to do is load
the program, set some options, pick a directory, and let it go.

I experimented with a new coding style in this program.  It's K&R-style with
four tab spaces.


Known Issues:
- Trying to view an image that doesn't exist will crash the program.  This is
  FreeImage's fault.
- The configuration is not currently saved.
